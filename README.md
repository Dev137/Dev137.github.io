# MRC-Three.js-WebGL-Loader

This program takes a MRC file, parses it, converts the MRC data to a volume and renders the volume slices.  

This is written with using Three.js and HTML and will be updated to run with AngularJS in the near future.

Steps to use this:
You can simply download and run the HTML file in the main folder to see the full functionaloty of the MRC file loader.
Also, you can change your model by including the .mrc in the models/mrc/ folder and replacing the file name in the HTML file.
